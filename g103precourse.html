        I was born in Milford Memorial Hospital in Milford, Delaware
        (that's Sussex County for those interested). Delivered by the same doctor
        who delivered my two older sisters. I went to Boston University for

      My wife Leah and I lived in Boulder for three years (before returning to Maine for two) while she pursued her Masters
      Degree in Counseling Psychology. We were married just over two years ago out on
      Cure Organic Farm.<br>
